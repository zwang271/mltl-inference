Next Steps to try:

Implement SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)#Explore more on this area to solve to solve the constraints in the formula.
Update heuristic function and relevance function.
Create rankings for formulas - use probability estimates to assign confidence scores to the generated formulas based on their consistency with the traces.
Perform equivalence checking to avoid redundancy
Parallelize the algorithm to improve the performance.
